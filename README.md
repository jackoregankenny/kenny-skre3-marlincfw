Install like any other firmware on the skr mini e3

Copy the file .pio/build/STM32F103RC_btt_512K/firmware.bin to a microSD card and boot it

This was not made for the Ender 3, I just happen to have a very similar build and it seems to work well. 

This current version has:
<ul>
<li>Marlin 2.0.2.5 + bugfixes</li>
<li>Bl-Touch Enabled Bi-linear leveling and</li> 
<li>Replaced ABS preheat with PETG as PETG seems to be overtaking ABS in popularity, plus I use it more </li>
<li>Thermal Runaway Prtection</li>
<li>S-curve acceleration</li>
<li>no boot splash, saves memory and faster boot
<li>buzzer is turned off</li>
<li>current changes for tmc drivers, based on my config</li>
<li>Various improvements in configuration</li>
</ul>

Please let us know if Marlin misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).


## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
